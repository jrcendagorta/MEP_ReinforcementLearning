# MEP Reinforcement Learning (In Development)


This code is in the prcess of developing a ML agent capable of determining 
the minimum free energy path.

v0.1: Develop NN model and environment to sucessfully reach energy basin starting from
      another energy basin. Environment has been created as well as DeepQ Neural Network
      
      -Next steps:
            Create itnerface between environment and neural network
            Train hyperparameters
